// INIT         - Startup the FSM, move to WANDER_S
// WANDER_S     - Wanders alone until it finds someone interesting.
//              If proposal is succesfull, proceed TO_REGISTRY
// TO_REGISTRY  - Checks the nearest register around it and using A*,
//              get the shortest ROUTE_TO_REG
// ROUTE_TO_REG - In possesion of the path to guide it to the nearest registry,
//              it follows the path and WAIT_FIANCE
// WAIT_FIANCE  - Waits for the parter to follow it's shortest path to same registry
// MARRY        - Time to make things official. Both update positions to same location,
//              and walk together as WANDER_M
// DIVORCE      - Sometimes things don't go well. Both split and start WANDER_S -
//              They make sure to walk few steps away (4x) in order to avoid re-marriage
// WANDER_M     - Cople wandering - They can walk together, meet more interesting
//              people and get divorced in case their bond is not strong enough
